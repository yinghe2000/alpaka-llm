Training a TinyBERT-like model specifically for kindergarten kids is a complex task that involves several steps, including data collection, model training, and fine-tuning. The process described in the TinyBERT paper involves distilling knowledge from a larger BERT model into a smaller model. However, to tailor it specifically for kindergarten content, you would need to fine-tune the distilled model on a dataset appropriate for young children. Here's a high-level overview of how you might approach this:

Data Collection:

Collect a large corpus of text suitable for kindergarten kids. This could include children's books, educational materials, and age-appropriate stories.
Preprocessing:

Preprocess the text data for training. This includes tokenization, normalization (like converting to lowercase, removing punctuation), and potentially segmenting the text into sentences or phrases.
Model Distillation:

Start with a pre-trained BERT model.
Follow the distillation process as outlined in the TinyBERT paper, which involves training a smaller model (the "student") to replicate the behavior of the larger model (the "teacher"). This process requires significant computational resources.
Fine-Tuning for Kindergarten Data:

Once you have the distilled TinyBERT model, fine-tune it on your collected kindergarten text data. This step adjusts the model to be more suited for the language and content relevant to young children.
Implementation:

Implement the fine-tuning process using a deep learning framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch, along with the Hugging Face Transformers library for handling BERT models.
Evaluation and Iteration:

After fine-tuning, evaluate the model's performance on tasks relevant to kindergarten kids, such as simple question answering or text generation.
Iterate the process based on performance, potentially adjusting the fine-tuning data or parameters.
Remember, this is a non-trivial task that requires expertise in machine learning, NLP, and a good understanding of educational content for young children. Additionally, the computational resources required for training and distilling models like BERT are substantial.
